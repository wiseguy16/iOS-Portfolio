# iOS-Portfolio

My name is Greg Weiss and I have a passion for building great Apps! I try to find unique ways to solve everyday problems and add a little creativity and ingenuity in the process. Here are a few examples of my work:

#AudioAssist

Developed by an audio engineer for audio technicians, AudioAssist is designed to minimize the chaos associated with band and/or show rehearsals. Customizable to venue and personnel, this complex (but easy to use) chat app is a quick and efficient means of communication between production technicians and the musicians they serve.

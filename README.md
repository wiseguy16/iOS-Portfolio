My name is Greg Weiss and I have a passion for building great Apps! I try to find unique ways to solve everyday problems and add a little creativity and ingenuity in the process. Here are a few examples of my work:

#Finger Paints
A simple drawing app for when your markers aren't nearby.

An app that searches a database and displays relevant movie information.

A news app for a large Orlando church that shows current videos, blogs and plays sermon audio podcasts.
